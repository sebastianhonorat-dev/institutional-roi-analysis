# Institutional ROI Analysis

**Course:** Advanced Data Science — Spring 2026  
**Instructor:** Prof. Gustavo García Melero  
**Team:** Sebastian Honorat, Frank Vela  

---

## Overview

This project investigates **institutional return on investment (ROI)** in U.S. higher education by comparing economic outcomes to institutional constraints at the degree level.

The core goal is to move beyond raw earnings or debt figures and instead evaluate how effectively institutions perform **relative to expectations**, given factors such as selectivity, size, and student composition.

At its current stage, the project focuses on **data ingestion and exploratory analysis** using the U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard API, with plans to integrate OpenAlex research output data in later phases.

---

## Research Focus

Key questions guiding the project:

- Which institutions deliver **higher-than-expected economic outcomes** for graduates of a specific degree?
- How do earnings and debt outcomes vary when normalized against institutional constraints?
- How might economic ROI and research productivity differ across institutions with similar profiles?

> **Note:** A final ROI or ranking equation has not yet been defined and will be developed iteratively based on data quality and exploratory findings.

## Data Sources

### College Scorecard API
Used for degree-level outcomes and institutional characteristics, including:
- Median earnings
- Student debt
- Completion and retention rates
- Admissions and selectivity proxies

### OpenAlex Scholarly Knowledge Graph *(planned)*
Intended for future integration of:
- Publication counts by institution
- Citation impact metrics
- Field-normalized research output

---

## Current Project Status

### Implemented
- College Scorecard API ingestion
- Environment-based API key management
- Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebooks
- CSV persistence of ingested data

### In Progress / Planned
- Robust pagination handling for full API coverage
- Definition of a degree-level institutional ROI or value-added metric
- Integration of OpenAlex research data
- Comparative institutional analysis

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- Machine learning models
- Predictive modeling beyond baseline expectation frameworks

## Setup & Usage

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```env
COLLEGE_SCORECARD_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENALEX_API_KEY=your_key_here

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Data Ingestion

Run the College Scorecard ingestion script:

python src/ingest_scorecard.py

This script retrieves data from the API and writes CSV files to:

data/raw/scorecard/

    There is currently no unified main script. Ingestion and analysis are intentionally modular.

Notes & Limitations

    API pagination is not yet fully implemented; current ingestion may not capture all available pages.

    ROI and ranking methodologies are under active design and have not been finalized.

    Results at this stage should be considered exploratory, not definitive rankings.

Academic & Portfolio Use

This repository is structured to support:

    Reproducible academic analysis

    Transparent methodological development

    Incremental expansion into a broader institutional performance framework
